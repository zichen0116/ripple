## 0.1.17

### Patch Changes

- [#1177](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1177)
  [`054bd1e`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/054bd1e75347e395f6c096f8e293d1baf8e03549)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Parse tags and bare fragments
  as native TSRX by default, remove `component` keyword parsing, and
  compile/format/lint function components that return native TSRX across the
  React, Preact, Solid, Vue, and Ripple targets. Ripple component compilation now
  only renders TSRX reachable from returned values and supports string and `null`
  component returns.

  Ripple now also preserves directly called PascalCase helpers as ordinary
  functions while still compiling renderable component functions used as
  components or render entries.

  The old explicit TSRX wrapper tag is no longer special; TSRX elements and
  fragments are the default expression syntax, and the tag name is treated like
  any ordinary element name.

  Ripple now exports a typed `Fragment` helper from its public runtimes and
  supports `innerHTML` on both host elements and `Fragment`. Ripple also treats
  `innerHTML` from element spreads as rendered content instead of serializing it
  as an `innerhtml` attribute.

  The `{html ...}` template directive has been removed. Use each target's native
  raw HTML prop instead, such as `innerHTML` for Ripple/Solid/Vue or
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for React/Preact.

  The `{text ...}` template directive has also been removed. Text values now use
  ordinary `{expr}` containers, with explicit coercion written as JavaScript
  (`String(value)`, `value + ''`, or a typed string value). Ripple optimizes
  clearly string-shaped expressions and typed string props into text-node updates
  without requiring a TSRX-specific directive.

  [`d045396`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/d0453962cfe1df7a98a0981b0bf3e5729195a9ae)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Align prop getter generation
  for JSX-style TSRX expression fragments with native TSRX component templates.
  Reject native dynamic marker syntax on TSX attribute names and inside TSX
  fragments.

## 0.1.15

### Patch Changes

- [#1173](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1173)
  [`ea717f2`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/ea717f2ac20901aca59946c1cea8066c28a4220c)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Preserve comments inside
  destructured typed parameters and type literals during formatting.

## 0.1.14

### Patch Changes

- [#1166](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1166)
  [`1dc0331`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/1dc0331f7b7296545ee459dc31a92057871cbb0d)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Replace all [0] and [1]
  compiled output with `.value` and direct `lazy` Throw runtime errors for direct
  `[0]` and `[1]` access on tracked and derived values. Fix type removal for
  non-tsx paths Remove the public `get` and `set` exports in favor of `.value`
  access. Ignore lazy writes past the tracked tuple length instead of creating
  numeric properties.

- [#1169](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1169)
  [`bf1cb96`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/bf1cb96f2ea9b325e30f5a051c451f92659d20f9)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Type host `ref={...}`
  attributes, named ref props, and generated ref keys so inline callbacks
  `{ref ...}` receive element-specific JSX types.

  Exclude `returnType` from the compiler types that use typeAnnotation instead due
  to the way `@sveltejs/acorn-typescript` parses them.

## 0.1.13

### Patch Changes

- [#1162](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1162)
  [`95c2976`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/95c2976b9ec2c20c4160ad13b636c1ed03e863ef)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Allow native TSRX shorthand
  attributes inside `<tsrx>` blocks nested under TSX.

  [`2acbbea`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/2acbbea9253ac8f516fe0d3a7a38331490e6fd8b)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Transform nested `<tsrx>`
  templates inside TSX expressions instead of preserving invalid `<tsrx>` JSX tags
  in framework output.

- [#1153](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1153)
  [`9df9fe3`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/9df9fe3a2d26978e69172db84994ac496761cd04)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Parse nested `<tsrx>` islands
  inside `<tsx>` expression containers as native TSRX so setup declarations and
  references keep Volar mappings, and hydrate deeply nested `<tsx>`/`<tsrx>`
  expression values without skipping server markers.

## 0.1.11

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Improve JSX event handler
  typings to infer specific DOM event types. Improve all JSX types for much
  improved typescript support. Mark self-closing JSX tokens as completion-capable
  so empty attribute positions can surface editor completions. Fix no intellisense
  on dom attributes when <style> blocks were present Share scoped CSS selector
  metadata across TSRX targets so class-name definitions work outside Ripple too.
  CMD+click now jumps to class definitions for all tsrx platforms.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- [#1135](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1135)
  [`b1d6de0`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b1d6de05912aca4cf40af68f291851eda706140c)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Support sole-child
  `{html ...}` raw HTML lowering for React, Preact, Solid and Vue targets, while
  keeping Ripple's existing child raw HTML behavior unchanged.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Use esrap 2.2.8 instead of
  carrying a local 2.2.7 patch.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- [#1126](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1126)
  [`2b1f746`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/2b1f7469ab31713140a5baf912a19fa8eedb9234)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Keep runtime helper imports
  on namespaced runtime subpaths so production app bundles do not pull in
  compiler-only modules.

- [#1123](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1123)
  [`e4a04dd`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/e4a04ddb4bbc8e21a9c7c2c65b179d764b72e4fb)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Nested lazy destructuring
  support for all tsrx targets. Ripple already fully supported it.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- [`a59ccb8`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/a59ccb83b91257bf34fca2ba1415e77d1f815a7b)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Republish version with the
  new publish.yaml workflow

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- [#1110](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1110)
  [`de27e18`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/de27e182d002ea736aee992acca4cbf9873a307d)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Drop the
  continuation/tail-helper lift for hook-bearing `if`, `switch`, `try`, and
  `for-of` blocks in React and Preact output. The pattern existed to forward
  post-hook mutations through to statements after the control-flow construct, but
  the hook-callback-outer-mutation and hook-result-outer-assignment validations
  make those mutations unreachable. The hook-bearing branch is still wrapped in
  its own `StatementBodyHook` helper to satisfy Rules of Hooks; trailing
  statements now stay in the parent component instead of being lifted into a tail
  helper. For-of helpers no longer thread an `_tsrx_isLast_*` prop or emit an
  empty-source fallback. Output is smaller and easier to read with no behavior
  change for valid programs.

- [`59e1e32`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/59e1e328607598fe342abbba35f76e5fadb9ca5c)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix parsing for
  statement-bodied `<tsrx>` templates used directly as self-closing JSX component
  attribute values.

- [#1116](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1116)
  [`1256569`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/12565695efaa3a4ad429245807721ea671c2ecb5)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Compile `for ... of` in React
  and Preact components through a new `map_iterable` runtime helper instead of an
  inline `Array.isArray(src) ? src : Array.from(src)` normalization followed by
  `.map(...)`. Both the non-hook and hook-bearing lowerings now emit a single
  `map_iterable(source, (item, i) => ...)` call that accepts any `Iterable` —
  `Set`, `Map`, generators, and other iterators — without copying arrays. The
  helper is imported from a new target-namespaced subpath: `@tsrx/react/runtime`
  for React output and `@tsrx/preact/runtime` for Preact output, both of which
  re-export from `@tsrx/core/runtime`, so end-user projects only need the target
  package installed. Loop-scoped TS types in editor-tooling (non-module-scoped
  helper) output reference the new `IterationValue<T>` helper so destructured
  `Map` entries and other non-array sources type-check correctly.

- [#1116](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1116)
  [`1256569`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/12565695efaa3a4ad429245807721ea671c2ecb5)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Allow native TSRX template
  expression containers to recover from a trailing semicolon before the closing
  brace while reporting an editor diagnostic.

- [#1112](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1112)
  [`18b4aef`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/18b4aefa8127e56a9f1b3058da2d4d2172551579)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Support JavaScript `switch`
  fall-through semantics in component templates across the React, Preact, Solid,
  and Vue targets. When a `case` body has no `break` (or terminal `return`), each
  entry case now renders its own body plus every downstream body it would have
  fallen into — matching JS spec and the existing Ripple runtime behavior.

  All four targets reuse the same `create_hook_safe_helper` lift that hook-bearing
  case bodies already go through, orchestrated by a shared `plan_switch_lift`
  planner exported from `@tsrx/core`. Any case body that appears in more than one
  arm after fall-through analysis is hoisted into its own `StatementBodyHook`
  helper component, and each upstream arm chains into the next helper at the end
  of its body. Each case body therefore appears exactly once in the generated
  module regardless of how many arms reach it, keeping bundle size linear in case
  count and source mappings 1:1 for editor IntelliSense. Cases that terminate with
  `break` (or aren't reached via fall-through) stay inline as before.
  - **React, Preact, Vue** keep the JS `switch` and emit case arms that
    `return <Helper/>` for lifted bodies; inline arms append `<NextHelper/>` as
    the chain entry point.
  - **Solid** lowers each entry case to a `<Match>` whose body is the lifted
    helper element, or for inline arms a fragment of the inline JSX plus a chain
    `<NextHelper/>`.

  Vue's and Solid's client transforms now hoist all `StatementBodyHook` helpers —
  not just the fall-through ones — to module scope (Vue wraps each in
  `defineVaporComponent`). Every control flow that already went through the lift
  on React (hook-bearing `if`, `switch`, `try`, and `for-of` bodies) now produces
  a single top-level helper instead of a per-render lazy initializer.
  `compile_to_volar_mappings` opts back out via
  `moduleScopedHookComponents: false` so Volar's virtual TSX keeps helpers local —
  closure-captured bindings stay resolvable against the component body for type
  checking.

  Create map helper functions for for-of loops to be used in the future transforms

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [#1104](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1104)
  [`3e84758`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/3e847588027d6254c3999a87c717e9d58fb55a26)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Tighten hook outer-binding
  validator around `for…of`:
  - A non-declaration target (`for (x of items)`) was being treated as a local
    declaration, hiding later hook-result assignments to the same outer binding.
  - `let`/`const` declared by a for-of (`for (const x of items)`) was likewise
    being added to the _enclosing_ block's shadowed set, even though the binding
    is scoped to the loop in JavaScript. This let after-loop assignments to a
    same-named outer binding (e.g.,
    `for (const x of items) { … } [x] = useState(0)`) escape detection.
    Loop-declared names are now scoped to the body sub-tree only.
  - The for-of's own iteration assignment was not inspected at all, so iterating a
    hook-derived value into an outer binding (e.g., `for (x of useState(0))` or
    `for ([a, b] of [useState(0)])`) silently lost the rebind in the emitted code.

  All three shapes now report the same diagnostic as a direct hook-result
  assignment to an outer binding.

- [#1104](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1104)
  [`3e84758`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/3e847588027d6254c3999a87c717e9d58fb55a26)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Constrain React and Preact hook
  isolation so hook results cannot cross generated hook component boundaries,
  reject hook callbacks that mutate parent-scope bindings across those boundaries,
  and keep hook-bearing `<tsrx>` expressions in regular functions behind stable
  helper components.

- [#1105](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1105)
  [`509170b`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/509170ba3cecc611ba1798575c70555070665736)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix parsing native TSRX
  statements before later JavaScript statements inside JSX attribute callbacks.

  [`5a59d73`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/5a59d73daf60b2652c86ffad2a4eaf3d801e40d7)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Parse statement-position

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Keep explicit return values

  [`5a59d73`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/5a59d73daf60b2652c86ffad2a4eaf3d801e40d7)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Parser fix for fragment
  expression values inside JSX attribute objects/arrays. Previously the leaked
  `tc_expr, b_stat` token contexts after a fragment caused the next entry's `<` to
  be tokenized as a TS relational operator instead of `jsxTagStart`. Affected
  shapes:
  - `params={{ list: [<>A</>, <>B</>] }}` (multi-fragment array as object
    property)
  - `params={{ a: <>X</>, b: ... }}` (fragment as object property followed by
    another property)
  - `params={{ list: [<><span>A</span></>, <><span>B</span></>] }}` (same shapes
    with fragments containing child elements)

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Parser fix for <tsrx> -
  cleans up the pending token context for }, ), ], plus the callback-return case:
  parenthesized: content={(<tsrx>...</tsrx>)} passed as a call arg:

- [#1064](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1064)
  [`eae7b40`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/eae7b4047f4d8cc7a0278fb48ffe630d73a592c6)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Reject component declarations
  with more than one parameter. Previously, JSX targets passed extra parameters
  straight through into the generated function and ripple silently dropped them.
  Multi-parameter components now error in regular compile and are surfaced as
  collected diagnostics in the Volar editor pipeline.

  [`b34b95a`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b34b95a808ec801109d1818f4d24ae0bbc00f66b)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Enforces a stricter rule for

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Introduces a typeOnly flag to
  transformers to compile for either production or editor support.

  Lazy transformations for typeOnly are not skipped, only the & is removed to make

  blocks, fragment-as-element, `for await...of`) now push onto `result.errors` so

  on top of a still-valid virtual TSX, mirroring how `@tsrx/ripple` already
  behaves.

  [`bce43be`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/bce43be304812ca04dd8d196e2439f28ea392237)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Compile-time merge for
  multiple ref expressions, plus a diagnostic for duplicate `ref={...}`
  attributes.

  **New rule**: an element may have at most one TSX-style `ref={...}` attribute.
  Multiple `ref={...}` on the same element is now a compile error — they would
  otherwise produce duplicate JSX props (last-wins at runtime, can't be typed
  cleanly). The error suggests the supported alternative.

  **Multiple `{ref expr}` keyword-form refs are still supported and merge into one
  ref**:
  - `@tsrx/react`, `@tsrx/preact`, and `@tsrx/vue` emit
    `ref={mergeRefs(a, b, ...)}`, importing the shared `mergeRefs` helper from
    `@tsrx/react/merge-refs`, `@tsrx/preact/merge-refs`, and
    `@tsrx/vue/merge-refs` respectively. The helper supports function refs,
    React-style `{ current }` ref objects, and Vue-style `{ value }` ref objects
    (e.g. from `ref()` / `useTemplateRef()`), and composes React 19 cleanup return
    values.
  - `@tsrx/solid` emits `ref={[a, b, ...]}`, which Solid's runtime iterates
    natively.

  A single `ref={...}` may be combined with any number of `{ref expr}` on the same
  element — they all merge together. Single-ref elements (either syntax) emit
  unchanged with no helper import.

  `@tsrx/vue` previously merged multiple `{ref expr}` into an inline arrow
  callback that only worked for function refs. Vue now uses the shared `mergeRefs`
  helper, which fixes Vue ref-object handling (`ref()` / `useTemplateRef()`) and
  the previously-broken combo case (`<el ref={a} {ref b} />`).

  [`f660969`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/f66096972bc8d2f03061e6018d03e40207761aaa)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Fix Vue early-return lowering
  so continuation-local refs stay stable across parent updates.

  Also make `if (cond) return;` early returns in Vue components reactive after
  mount. Previously the early return was emitted as a setup-time `if` block, which
  only evaluated `cond` once when `setup()` ran and never again — so flipping the
  condition after mount didn't toggle the continuation.

  The lowering now picks one of two paths based on the continuation:
  - **Pure JSX continuation** — inlined as a render-time ternary
    (`cond ? null : <continuation/>`). Cheapest path, no extra component.
  - **Continuation with setup-time statements** (`provide`, `watch`,
    `watchEffect`, declarations, plain function calls, etc.) — moved into a
    `StatementBodyHook` helper component whose setup runs only when the helper
    mounts. This keeps those statements scoped to the continuation's lifecycle so
    e.g. `provide` is only visible to descendants while the continuation is
    active.

  React, Preact, and Solid lowering is unchanged: their bodies re-run on every
  render, so the existing setup-time `if` already behaves reactively.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Replace `node:crypto` usage
  in the compiler with a pure-JS implementation so Ripple can be compiled inside
  browser workers (e.g. the Monaco-based playground) where `crypto.createHash` is
  not available.

  The hashing utility is split into two functions:
  - `simple_hash` — fast non-cryptographic djb2 (base36). Used for CSS class-name
    prefixes and runtime `{html}` hydration markers where the input is user
    content and the output multiplies across the shipped bundle.
  - `strong_hash` — preimage-resistant SHA-256 prefix (pure-JS via
    `@noble/hashes`). Used everywhere a hash is derived from a server-only
    filesystem path (`#server` RPC ids, `track`/`trackAsync` ids, head-element
    hydration markers) so the hash can't be inverted to reveal the original path.

  The runtime `ripple` package no longer ships its own `hashing.js` — it
  re-exports `simple_hash`/`strong_hash` from `@tsrx/core`, and the compiler emits
  `_$_.simple_hash` (previously `_$_.hash`) for dynamic `{html}` hydration
  markers.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Extract JSX-emitting targets
  into a shared `createJsxTransform` factory in `@tsrx/core`; React, Preact, and
  Solid now plug in via a `JsxPlatform` descriptor so source-mapping fixes
  propagate to all three targets.
  - `@tsrx/core` adds the `createJsxTransform` factory, `JsxPlatform` /
    `JsxPlatformHooks` / `JsxTransformResult` types, and a shared test harness at
    `@tsrx/core/test-harness/source-mappings`. The source-map segments walker now
    handles `TSTypePredicate` and uses strict mapping lookups throughout.
  - `compile_to_volar_mappings` no longer crashes on common AST shapes across all
    three targets: `NewExpression`, `ReturnStatement`, `ForStatement` /
    `ForInStatement`, `TemplateLiteral`, `TaggedTemplateExpression`,
    `AwaitExpression`, computed `MemberExpression`, empty / non-empty
    `ObjectExpression`, class methods (including async, get / set, static) and
    object method shorthand, TS generics, type predicates (`x is T` and
    `asserts x is T`), as-expressions, union / array type annotations,
    self-closing JSX, element attribute spread, and `JSXExpressionContainer`
    inside `<tsx>` blocks.
  - `<tsx>` / `<>` single-child unwrapping is now JSX-context-aware:
    `return <tsx>{'x'}</tsx>` compiles to `return 'x';` rather than invalid
    `return {'x'};`, while `<b><>{111}</></b>` still preserves the inner `{111}`
    container.
  - Class methods no longer crash source-map collection (every function-like node
    gets `metadata` defaulted).

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Fix parser crash when a JS
  statement inside an element template body has no trailing whitespace before the
  closing tag (e.g. `<ul>var a = "123"</ul>`). The tokenizer previously misread
  `</` as a less-than operator followed by a regexp.

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Extract compiler into
  `@tsrx/core` and `@tsrx/ripple` packages
  - `@tsrx/core`: Core compiler infrastructure — parser factory, scope management,
    utilities, constants, and type definitions
  - `@tsrx/ripple`: Ripple-specific compiler — RipplePlugin, analyze,
    client/server transforms
  - Remove compiler source code from `ripple` package (consumers should use
    `@tsrx/ripple`)
  - Migrate eslint-plugin type imports to `@tsrx/core/types/*`
  - Remove unused compiler dependencies from `ripple` package
